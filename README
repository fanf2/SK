Simple SK combinator reduction engine
-------------------------------------

Written by Tony Finch <dot@dotat.at>


This program uses SK combinators to implement a lazy functional
programming language, as described by Turner (1979) and Peyton Jones
(1987), and as previously implemented by me in a less helpful way.

The combinator expression is represented as a graph in the heap. Each
node is a pair of words which normally represent the application of a
function to an argument. Words can either be small integers (which
identify primitive combinators) or pointers to other nodes. There are
two exceptions:

Double precision floating point numbers are stored in the second word
of a node following a special small integer tag. Neither of these can
appear in any other context, except temporarily when unwinding the
spine with a number at the head.

During garbage collection, nodes that have been moved from the old heap
to the new heap are replaced with another special tag and a pointer to
the node's new location.

Evaluation proceeds in normal order, by repeatedly reducing the leftmost
outermost application. We find this redex by unwinding the spine of the
program graph using Schorr-Waite pointer reversal, which requires
minimal state outside the graph. When we reach the head of the spine we
find a primitive combinator; this is reduced by rewinding enough to
collect its arguments, then overwriting the root of the redex with the
result.

The key variables in the evaluator are:

  fun: root of the current redex
  box: alias for the heap node pointed to by fun
  arg: the pointer-reversed list of the extra arguments applied to the redex
  aN:  argument words collected when rewinding

The primitive numeric functions assume that their arguments have already
been evaluated. In order to support this, numbers also act as
combinators that take a continuation to which the evaluated number is
passed. The numeric primitives can then be wrapped in a function that
forces evaluation of their arguments:

  \wrap = (\op \a1 \a2
    a1 \n1
    a2 \n2
    op n1 n2)

The primitive I/O functions are designed to be used in monadic style. As
well as their basic arguments they take a continuation and a token
representing the state of the world. After performing their side effects
they pass the world to the continuation.

New nodes are constructed using a bump allocator. The heap layout is:

  heap_lo  <= [ allocated nodes ] < heap_ptr
  heap_ptr <= [ free space      ] < heap_hi

The garbage collector creates a new heap and moves the live data into
it, using Cheney's algorithm. This has the invariants:

  new  <= [ nodes pointing to new heap ] < scan
  scan <= [ nodes pointing to old heap ] < ptr
  ptr  <= [ free space                 ] < new + heap_size

If the live data fills more than half the new heap, double the heap size
will be used in the next GC run.
